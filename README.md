**News Analysis System Readme**

This system is designed to help users understand news articles better by performing three key analyses: cleaning up articles, checking the mood, and finding connections. It provides a unified platform where users can input news articles and receive a mood rating, short summary, and insights into common themes across multiple articles.

### How to Run the Program

1. **Installation**

   Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

2. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Program**

   Execute the main script to run the news analysis system:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

   Follow the prompts to input news articles and view the analysis results.

### Tools/Libraries Used

- **Python**: The programming language used for implementing the news analysis system.
  
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**: NLTK is a leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data. It provides easy-to-use interfaces to over 50 corpora and lexical resources such as WordNet, along with a suite of text processing libraries for tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning.

- **spaCy**: spaCy is an open-source natural language processing library designed for production use. It provides efficient, easy-to-use implementations of common NLP tasks such as named entity recognition (NER), part-of-speech (POS) tagging, and dependency parsing.

- **scikit-learn**: scikit-learn is a simple and efficient tool for data mining and data analysis. It features various classification, regression, and clustering algorithms, including those commonly used in sentiment analysis and topic modeling.

### Why These Tools/Libraries?

- **NLTK**: Chosen for its extensive range of text processing functionalities and ease of use, making it suitable for tasks such as cleaning up articles and text preprocessing.

- **spaCy**: Selected for its efficiency and accuracy in performing advanced NLP tasks like named entity recognition and dependency parsing, which are essential for mood analysis and aspect analysis.

- **scikit-learn**: Utilized for its robust implementations of machine learning algorithms, particularly for sentiment analysis and topic modeling, enabling accurate and scalable analysis of news articles.

### Additional Notes

- The system may require additional configuration or adjustments depending on the specific use case or requirements of the user.

- Integration with external APIs or services for sentiment analysis and text summarization can further enhance the capabilities of the system.

- Contributions, bug reports, and feedback are welcome. Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests on the GitHub repository.
