"Retailers, the makers of foods marketed for weight loss, and other types of companies could see knock-on effects from the rise of diabetes and weight loss drugs like Ozempic.

As they do every summer, publicly traded companies posted their second-quarter results while Americans were baring their bodies on the beach. But this year, the timing was apt. On several earnings calls in August, chief executives reassured investors that the Ozempic revolution had not left them in the dust, and that they could somehow share in the blazing success of new diabetes and weight loss drugs. “It puts us in a good position to be a solution for those who are on the drugs,” said Dan R. Chard, the chief executive of Medifast, which makes diet products like shakes and protein bars, adding: “They’re looking for guidance.” He told analysts this even while explaining that new-generation drugs had helped pummel earnings, down 34.7 percent year on year. “We will continue to study this,” Michael Johnson, the chief executive of the nutritional supplement maker Herbalife, told investors. “And when we see an opportunity to capitalize on it, we will.” In theory, that opportunity — both for making profits and for losing fortunes — could be vast not only for the companies behind these drugs but also for some in completely different industries.

Known as GLP-1 drugs, the medications are already driving big profits. Novo Nordisk makes both Ozempic, which has been approved only for Type 2 diabetes, and its close relative Wegovy, which has been approved for weight loss. They mimic a glucagon-like peptide that regulates appetite in the brain, leaving people feeling sated for hours. Together, they helped send Novo’s earnings rocketing up 32 percent in the first half of this year, and Novo’s market value is now larger than the entire Danish economy. Eli Lilly’s sales surged 28 percent in the second quarter, thanks to another diabetes drug, Mounjaro, which the Food and Drug Administration may approve for weight loss this year. And the full potential isn’t even clear yet. The market for weight loss drugs is huge: There are roughly 750 million obese people worldwide, including about 42 percent of adults in the United States, where obesity-related illnesses incur billions of dollars in health care costs each year. But Novo says GLP-1 drugs could eventually have other uses, like helping prevent cardiovascular disease among obese adults. There are signs they could treat addiction and even Alzheimer’s, too. “The market potential is very, very significant,” Novo’s chief financial officer, Karsten Knudsen, told me when I visited the company in June. “We’re operating in kind of unusual territory.”

The ripple effects are widening. Retailers like Walmart, Kroger and Rite Aid say GLP-1 prescriptions are bringing more people into stores, where they make other purchases. Walmart’s chief executive, Doug McMillon, told analysts in August that its executives “expect consumables, and health and wellness, primarily due to the popularity of some GLP-1 drugs, to grow as a percent of total.” Medtronic’s chief executive, Geoff Martha, said the company had seen a “modest” dip in bariatric surgery, presumably as people opted for weight loss drugs instead. And some analysts believe the drugs could disrupt the American diet. “If you’re eating fast food every day, you’ll probably continue to eat fast food every day,” James van Geelen of Citrinas Capital Management said on Bloomberg’s “Odd Lots” podcast. “You will just eat a lot less of it.” Still, there is room for other approaches to fighting obesity. “These drugs are game changers, but with an asterisk,” said David Ludwig, an obesity specialist and pediatrics professor at Harvard Medical School. (The drugs come with a long list of side effects.) “Even if you can reduce weight across the population with drugs, it’s not going to eliminate the risks of a poor diet.” Flush with cash, Novo agrees. “We need to be looking at what’s the next thing,” its executive vice president for commercial strategy Camilla Sylvest, told me. In June, the company launched an obesity prevention unit near Copenhagen, to research how to stop the disease before people need to take drugs to lose weight. — Vivienne Walt

The U.S. labor market begins to look like its old self. Employers added 187,000 jobs in August, the Labor Department reported Friday, and unemployment rose to 3.8 percent as the economy continued to lose momentum built up after pandemic lockdowns. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo visits China. She had the tricky task of promoting trade between the two superpowers while holding firm on technology export limits imposed in the name of American national security. The two countries agreed to create new dialogues, including a working group for commercial issues. The White House names the first drugs set for Medicare price negotiations. The long-awaited list of 10 medicines will be subject to a landmark new program meant to reduce costs for Medicare. Drugmakers have pushed back against the plan, including in court, and Republicans have criticized the initiative as government overreach. UBS reports a $29 billion quarterly profit, with an asterisk. The huge gain — the biggest in banking history — stems from the bank’s acquisition of its rival Credit Suisse this spring for about $3.2 billion, a steep discount that is skewing UBS’s results. But it belies the challenges that UBS faces as it moves to complete the largest takeover of a bank since the 2008 financial crisis. When Emily Weiss stepped down last year as the chief executive of Glossier, the skin care and beauty brand she founded in 2014, some called it the end of the “girlboss.” That archetype — of media-savvy female founders with venture-darling, millennial-focused start-ups — had been propelled by “#Girlboss,” the Nasty Girl founder Sophia Amoruso’s 2014 memoir.

Glossier, with its direct-to-consumer model and voice-y website, changed the way women buy makeup, eventually passing a $1 billion valuation. But the brand stumbled as it struggled to move into brick-and-mortar retail; faced criticism from retail employees who alleged a toxic, racist working environment; and shelved projects like a makeup line that departed from its dewy, barely-there look. DealBook spoke to Marisa Meltzer, author of the upcoming book “Glossy: Ambition, Beauty, and the Inside Story of Emily Weiss’s Glossier,” about what lessons we might glean from Weiss and the #Girlboss movement. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity. Can you contextualize the #Girlboss movement? It was pretty offensive and diminutive. No one except for Sophia was calling themselves out as a girlboss. But it was also something that benefited them because it attracted interest. It was a way for them to get press about their businesses that wasn’t the typical things that female founders and C.E.O.s sometimes had to do, like a fashion spread.

There was a big debate at the time over whether the press would have covered the scandals at companies like Outdoor Voices, Man Repeller and Glossier differently if they had men at the helm. What do you think? I think there was a bit of a thirst for blood. These women had been propped up in a way that was kind of annoying — I’m sure it was annoying to them, too. Some of those companies had real problems, like being sued over firing pregnant employees. And other companies had, like Glossier, an accusation of having a workplace, largely for their retail employees, that wasn’t ideal. That’s different than criminal behavior. The reality is these companies weren’t the same. The women at their helms were not all the same. And they weren’t making the same mistakes. And they also didn’t have the same level of success. What happens to Glossier now? Glossier seems to have taken the time since Emily stepped down to re-evaluate. They decided to really belatedly go into retail. They launched in Sephora last February. The larger task that they’re trying to do is make the company in better shape for an exit.",retailer maker food marketed weight loss type company could see effect rise diabetes weight loss drug like

"Move over, Ozempic — there’s a new drug in town.

Eli Lilly’s Zepbound, with the active ingredient tirzepatide, has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use by obese or overweight adults who have at least one weight-related health complication, like Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure or high cholesterol.

Tirzepatide, sold as Mounjaro, has already been approved for treating type 2 diabetes since May 2022, but now, patients can be prescribed the drug for chronic weight management.

“Obesity and overweight are serious conditions that can be associated with some of the leading causes of death such as heart disease, stroke and diabetes,” Dr. John Sharretts, the director of the Division of Diabetes, Lipid Disorders, and Obesity for the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a statement.

“In light of increasing rates of both obesity and overweight in the United States, today’s approval addresses an unmet medical need.”

Approximately 70% of Americans are overweight or obese, according to the FDA, and a worrying report published by the World Obesity Federation this year projected that more than half of the world’s population could be overweight or obese by 2035.

However, the FDA reports that dropping only 5% to 10% of overall body weight can lower the risk of developing heart disease as a result — cue weight management drugs, which can help people lose stubborn pounds when diet and exercise alone fail.

“Unfortunately, despite scientific evidence to the contrary, obesity is often seen as a lifestyle choice – something that people should manage themselves,” Dr. Leonard Glass, the senior vice president global medical affairs at Lilly Diabetes and Obesity, said in a statement.

“Lilly is aiming to eliminate misperceptions about this disease and transform how it can be managed.”

Zepbound, which was approved Wednesday, has been shown to be an effective chronic weight management drug in combination with lifestyle changes like diet and exercise by activating the receptors for two hormones — glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) — to suppress appetite, thereby curbing food intake.

Side effects of the weekly injectable include nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort or pain, fatigue, diarrhea, constipation burping, hair loss, acid reflux and allergic reactions.

In trials, the drug caused thyroid C-cell tumors in rodents, although it is unknown whether Zepbound can result in the same cancer in humans.

According to the drug’s manufacturer, Zepbound is expected to be available to Americans by the end of the year for a list price of approximately $1,059, which Eli Lilly estimates is 20% less than rival semaglutide, otherwise known as Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic or Wegovy, which costs a staggering $1,300.

But as the demand for a weight loss cure-all soars has led to a market of dangerous counterfeit dupes, which have landed desperate users in the hospital.

And, despite the pressure for more medication access, “it does not improve or change insurance coverage,” which has been limited, explained Dr. Angela Fitch, the chief medical officer at weight-inclusive healthcare company knownwell.

“It remains a problem that obesity is treated as a carve out condition instead of a standard benefit, despite the fact that it is a chronic condition,” she told The Post in a statement.

“We’re hopeful that with continued advocacy, advancement in science, and data, we will continue to see improved access to this life-changing medication.”",move ozempic new drug town eli lilly zepbound active ingredient tirzepatide approved food drug administration use obese overweight adult least one health complication like type 2 diabetes high blood pressure high cholesterol tirzepatide sold mounjaro already approved treating type 2 diabetes since may 2022 patient prescribed drug chronic weight management obesity overweight serious condition associated leading cause death heart disease stroke diabetes john sharretts director division diabetes lipid disorder obesity fda center drug evaluation research said statement light increasing rate obesity overweight united state today approval address unmet medical approximately 70 american overweight obese according fda worrying report published world obesity federation year projected half world population could overweight obese 2035 however fda report dropping 5 10 overall body weight lower risk developing heart disease result cue weight management drug help people lose stubborn pound diet exercise alone fail unfortunately despite scientific evidence contrary obesity often seen lifestyle choice something people manage leonard glass senior vice president global medical affair lilly diabetes obesity said statement lilly aiming eliminate misperceptions disease transform zepbound approved wednesday shown effective chronic weight management drug combination lifestyle change like diet exercise activating receptor two hormone insulinotropic polypeptide gip suppress appetite thereby curbing food intake side effect weekly injectable include nausea vomiting abdominal discomfort pain fatigue diarrhea constipation burping hair loss acid reflux allergic reaction trial drug caused thyroid tumor rodent although unknown whether zepbound result cancer human according drug manufacturer zepbound expected available american end year list price approximately eli lilly estimate 20 le rival semaglutide otherwise known novo nordisk ozempic wegovy cost staggering demand weight loss soar led market dangerous counterfeit dupe landed desperate user hospital despite pressure medication access improve change insurance coverage limited explained angela fitch chief medical officer healthcare company knownwell remains problem obesity treated carve condition instead standard benefit despite fact chronic condition told post statement hopeful continued advocacy advancement science data continue see improved access medication,"Side effects of the weekly injectable include nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort or pain, fatigue, diarrhea, constipation burping, hair loss, acid reflux and allergic reactions.

"Sept 14 (Reuters) - Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY.N) said on Thursday it plans to double the number of treatments it is testing in clinical trials, with a focus on cell therapies, over the next 18 months, as it contends with increasing generic competition for two of its top-selling drugs.

The drugmaker, which currently has six candidates in trials, will advance six more in its research pipeline - including three cell therapies that target immune system disorders and different types of cancer.

The New York-based company has been pressured by declining demand for two of its top drugs, the blood cancer treatment Revlimid and blood thinner Eliquis, which face generic competition.

Bristol and partner Pfizer's (PFE.N) blood thinner Eliquis was also on the list of 10 drugs that will be subject to the first-ever price negotiations by the U.S. Medicare health program.

The company recently received regulatory approval for a new cell therapy manufacturing facility in Devens, Massachusetts and Bristol said it will continue expanding its manufacturing capacity.

Bristol, which already has two approved cell therapies in the U.S., Breyanzi and Abecma, targeting different blood cancer indications, said it plans to continue development for treatment of other diseases such as lupus erythematosus and multiple sclerosis.

"Austin Wolcott was 18 years old and pretty sure he wouldn’t survive the year.

It was the summer of 2020, and Wolcott had been given the disheartening news that his Stage 4 Classical Hodgkin’s Lymphoma, which he’d been battling for just under a year, was back.

Despite aggressive chemotherapy, which briefly sent his cancer into remission, the malignancy spread to his vertebrae.

But his doctors at the Bone Marrow Transplant Clinic in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, had an idea.

Would Wolcott be willing to try a relatively new and experimental treatment, something called CAR-T therapy?

“I didn’t feel especially hopeful about it, but I was willing to try anything that may help,” says Wolcott.

Everything about CAR-T “sounded like something out of a science-fiction movie,” he says. “It was portrayed as this cancer-seeking missile that knew exactly where to go and what to do.”

That description isn’t hyperbolic, says Dr. Michael Chu, an oncologist who’s been leading CAR-T clinical trials at the Cross Cancer Institute in Edmonton, Alberta.

CAR-T therapy basically boils down to building cells that outsmart cancer, beating it at its own game.

“Cancers aren’t supposed to develop in humans,” Chu explains. “Our T-cells are capable of recognizing and killing mutated cells before that happens.” But cancer can be especially sneaky. “They hide their identifying barcodes so T-cells can’t see them.”

With CAR-T therapy, a patient’s own T-cells—white blood cells that fight viruses—are removed from their body and genetically edited with “a new barcode reader, hence the name chimeric antigen receptor (CAR),” Chu says.

Those new and improved, cancer-killing (and cancer-identifying) machines are returned to the body, ready to start an all-out cellular war.

Imagine your T-cells as mini-Terminators but without Arnold Schwarzenegger’s accent.

Although he was doubtful, Wolcott took a chance with the trial.

He received his first CAR-T infusion on Nov. 6, 2020. “The only side effects were some minor body aches,” he says.

Within days, his cancer was retreating.

A month later, it was gone. “As of today, I am two years, eight months, and 26 days into remission,” he says.

CAR-T therapy may not be a household name just yet, but it’s on the cusp of revolutionizing cancer treatment.

Since it was first approved by the FDA for advanced leukemia in 2017—then-FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb called it “a new frontier in medical innovation”—the science has jumped by leaps and bounds.

There are now six CAR-T therapies available for various blood cancers, used to target everything from lymphomas to leukemia to myeloma.

While still in the clinical trial stages, a 2022 report from the University of Philadelphia found that two out of three patients treated with CAR-T therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukemia were, more than a decade later, still in remission.

“So many patients have been miraculously cured by CAR-T,” says Dr. John F. DiPersio, chief of the division of oncology at Washington University in St. Louis.

He’s even watched a medical colleague, a cancer surgeon, come close to death because of lymphoma and then have a complete recovery thanks to CAR-T.

The science around CAR-T has come a long way since the ‘90s, when immunologists like Dr. Michel Sadelain were first trying to convince their peers that genetically engineered T-cells were a technology worth exploring.

“In the beginning, it was, ‘Why would one bother to engineer T cells?’; later it was, ‘This will not work,’” says Sadelain, who was recently awarded the Breakthrough Prize (along with University of Pennsylvania immunologist Carl June) for his work in CAR-T therapy. “After we demonstrated feasibility and efficacy in mice in 2003, it was, ‘This will not work in humans.’”

His ideas “ran contrary to the most common approach to stimulate T-cells, which is based in vaccines,” says Sadelain.

But with enough persistence (and some remarkable early trial results), the skepticism turned to excitement.

While the therapy worked miracles on some patients, on many others it did nothing, for reasons that still aren’t clear.

“Tumors evolve ways to suppress the immune system,” says Dr. Brian Brown, Director of the Icahn Genomics Institute at Mount Sinai in New York City. “For example, cancers will flip a switch on T-cells to turn them off. They put a brake on the T-cells.”

How they do this, and how T-cells can outsmart cancer cells at their own game, is still being investigated.

There’s also the problem of cytokines, the pesky molecules released by CAR-T cells that promote inflammation and can lead to dangerously high fevers, vomiting, and organ failure.

But recent research from Dr. Michael Mitchell, an associate professor in the School of Engineering and Applied Science at the University of Pennsylvania, has developed a new method to “essentially stop cytokine release (during CAR-T therapy),” he says.

Cells are treated with sugars and injected with a polymer called polyethylene glycol, which creates what Mitchell calls a “suit of armor” around the T-cells, preventing a cytokine release.

Mitchell feels hopeful that the new technology won’t just make a difference in current CAR-T therapies, but might even demonstrate “potential to address some of the grand challenges we face using CAR-T cells to treat solid tumors.”

Solid tumors, which comprise the majority of cancers—like breast, colon, or lung cancer — have so far eluded CAR-T therapy.

“Blood cancers are easier to attack with CAR T-cells,” says Chu. “They’re essentially there in the blood where the CAR T-cells are first introduced. But CAR T-cells have to ‘find’ solid tumors by crossing from the blood into organs and soft tissues.”

Manipulating T-cells into super CAR T-cells — the “armored” cells that Mitchell is developing—might be the key to finally making CAR-T a feasible option for attacking solid cancers.

And then there’s the issue of cost.

The out-of-pocket infusion price can range from $375,000 to $475,000 per person.

And while many insurance providers pay at least some of the bill — Medicare, for instance, reimburses around 65% of the treatment cost — that’s just for the procedure itself.

Side effects like high fever, severe nausea, and trouble breathing can keep a CAR-T patient in intensive care for weeks, and some have walked away $1 million in debt.

“The cost must come down,” says DiPersio.

The most obvious way to do that is by reducing regulatory mandates by the FDA — which DiPersio thinks is unlikely to happen — or developing “off-the-shelf” therapies, which use engineered cells from a third party rather than a patient’s own T-cells.

Big pharma companies like AstraZeneca and Novartis are already conducting trials on off-the-shelf technology.

Another development that could affect the staggering costs is transforming the treatment from a lengthy (and costly) hospital visit into an outpatient procedure, says Brown.

“The goal is a scenario where a patient can come in, be injected with DNA or RNA that will turn a fraction of the patient’s T cells into CAR-T cells, and they will go and kill the cancer cells. That would have a big impact on cost.”

Despite all the hurdles, many of those involved in CAR-T cell research are cautiously optimistic about where the technology is heading.

“This is the tip of the iceberg,” says Chu. “There are CAR T-cells that have shown significant activity against glioblastoma multiforme — the most common brain cancer, including the one that killed Senator John McCain—and some forms of muscle and bone cancers.”

Brown says CAR-T therapy has the potential to be used beyond just cancer, like inflammation, and autoimmune disease, “and possibly even to treat aging,” he says. “It’s not science fiction because all of these things have already been demonstrated in animal models and will eventually move to humans.”

Though these seismic shifts won’t happen overnight—“outside of pandemics, medicine moves slowly,” Brown says — it’s still remarkable what they’ve achieved so far.

What made Brown believe that this therapy was something special — that “we’re living just a few minutes after the Big Bang,” as he puts it —are the statistics.

“It’s very common for us to read results from clinical trials of new drugs and you have to squint to see the difference,” he says. “You read how the drug extended the life of sick patients from a six-month survival to an eight-month survival.”

But with CAR-T, he says, the numbers are more startling. “They’re reporting remissions of more than a year, and you don’t have to be a radiologist to see the differences. The tumor masses hadn’t just shrunk, they were completely gone from these patients.”

For Wolcott, who’s now 22 and living with his wife—whom he met soon after he got sick — in Greensboro, NC, he’s still in shock that the cancer he thought would kill him remains (for the moment) in his rear-view mirror.

“The day I found out I was officially in remission felt like the first day of my life,” he says.

To salute 1,000 days of being cancer-free, Wolcott celebrated with a trip in September to the Blue Ridge Rock Festival.

Standing and dancing for hours in the blazing Southern sun would’ve been unthinkable for Wolcott just a few years ago.

“There was a time during my treatment where I felt like I’d spend the rest of my life locked inside,” Wolcott says. “Every day that I’m alive and out in the world again, I feel grateful.”",austin

"Cancer, often referred to as the “emperor of all maladies,” is an unyielding adversary that presents formidable challenges to global health. It is a complex amalgamation of diseases, each with its own unique characteristics, making its treatment a continuous, arduous battle for both healthcare professionals and patients. In this ever-evolving landscape of cancer therapeutics, one name that is carving out a unique space with innovative solutions is CytoMed Therapeutics.

Equipped with a novel, disruptive approach that blends advanced cellular science with cutting-edge biotechnology, CytoMed is championing a revolution, aiming to transform the battlefield of cancer treatment. Their mission is not just about finding effective solutions, but also making those solutions accessible and affordable for all, thereby addressing one of the most significant barriers in cancer care - prohibitive costs. The journey of CytoMed encapsulates a determined stride towards breaking barriers, changing narratives, and bringing hope to millions affected by cancer globally.

Cancer, an umbrella term for a multitude of diseases characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of cells, stands as a testament to biological complexity. This conglomerate of diseases, each with unique genetic mutations, cellular interactions, and responses to external factors, puts forth a staggering level of intricacy, making it a considerable challenge to formulate and execute effective treatments. This complexity is not only confined to the biological dimension, but it also extends to the socio-economic aspects of cancer care.

The diverse range of cancer subtypes, each with distinct biological characteristics, necessitates the development of a plethora of therapies, each tailored to target a specific cancer type or stage. This approach, while potentially effective, inevitably inflates the cost of research, development, and production of these therapies, thereby driving up the overall cost of cancer treatment.

Adding to the equation, cancer’s relentless nature often demands long-term, intensive treatments, further escalating the financial burden on patients and healthcare systems. The financial toxicity associated with cancer treatment is so significant that it often poses an insurmountable barrier to access, making potentially lifesaving treatments unattainable for many patients.

In this context, Dr. Wee Kiat Tan, Chief Operating Officer of CytoMed Therapeutics, underlines a profound truth, saying, ""You could have the best solution to a disease or treatment, but if it is not affordable, how are you going to?"" This sentiment not only highlights the inherent challenge in cancer treatment but also brings to the fore the core philosophy of CytoMed Therapeutics – to develop not just effective, but also affordable solutions for cancer. In the ongoing war against cancer, Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy has emerged as a revolutionary ally. By leveraging the body's own immune system to fight cancer, CAR-T therapy has unlocked new avenues of hope for countless patients. This groundbreaking treatment modality involves genetically modifying a patient's T cells to recognize and destroy cancer cells, effectively turning the immune system into a potent, precise weapon against the disease.

CAR-T therapy, which represents a personalized approach to cancer treatment, has been particularly effective against blood cancers like leukemia and lymphoma. The results from various clinical trials have been compelling, with some patients achieving complete remission, a term rarely associated with advanced-stage cancer.

However, despite its transformative potential, CAR-T therapy has its own set of challenges. Firstly, the cost associated with this therapy is exceptionally high. This is largely because each CAR-T therapy is custom-made for each patient, involving a complex process of extraction, genetic modification, and reinfusion of T cells. This high degree of customization requires specialized labs, sophisticated technologies, and skilled personnel, all of which contribute to the overall cost. The patient-specific nature of CAR-T therapy means it cannot be mass-produced or stored for future use. This raises scalability issues, particularly when attempting to treat a large number of patients. In addition, the time taken from cell extraction to reinfusion can span several weeks, a duration during which the patient's condition can potentially deteriorate.

In light of the hurdles associated with traditional CAR-T therapy, CytoMed Therapeutics is offering a potentially game-changing alternative. The biotechnology company has pioneered a “one product, many patients” approach, a strategy that eliminates the need for patient-specific customization, thereby addressing some of the critical limitations of traditional CAR-T therapy.

At the core of CytoMed's strategy are Gamma Delta T cells, a subgroup of T cells derived from healthy donors. Gamma Delta T cells have long been an underappreciated part of the immune system, but recent research has begun to shed light on their potential. Unlike other T cells, Gamma Delta T cells can recognize a wide array of cancers without the need for complex genetic modification, which has conventionally been a prerequisite for CAR-T therapies.

The universal applicability of these cells allows CytoMed to create an “off-the-shelf"" product, a significant departure from the traditional CAR-T model. By eliminating the need for patient-specific customization, CytoMed's approach can reduce both the cost and logistical complexity associated with the therapy. In essence, the company is working to democratize access to this advanced cancer therapy, making it more accessible to a broader patient population.

By allowing for large-scale production of the therapy, CytoMed's model stands to significantly reduce the costs associated with CAR-T treatment. It could potentially transform CAR-T therapy from a high-cost, low-volume treatment into a more affordable, high-volume option, a shift that could revolutionize cancer treatment.

This “one product, many patients” paradigm, if successfully implemented, could mark a significant stride in the evolution of CAR-T therapy. By making a potent form of immunotherapy more universally applicable, CytoMed's approach could help to bring the promise of CAR-T therapy to a larger patient population. This is a critical step forward in making cancer treatment more equitable, affordable, and effective.

CytoMed's relentless drive for innovation continues to break new ground in CAR-T therapy. Ongoing research and potential advancements, such as enhancing the efficiency of Gamma Delta T cell extraction and refining their precision targeting capabilities, are actively being pursued.

The vision of a future where high-quality cancer therapy is not a privilege but a standard accessible to all grows ever closer with CytoMed's ongoing efforts. Dr. Tan passionately sums up this aspiration: ""You have a good solution, but you have to make it affordable.""",cancer often referred emperor malady unyielding adversary present formidable challenge

"Nov 28 (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said on Tuesday it was investigating cancer therapies made by companies such as Gilead Sciences (GILD.O) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) over the risk of hospitalizations and death due to a serious safety issue.

The FDA said it had received reports of T-cell malignancies, which refer to a group of blood disorders including lymphomas and leukemias, after treatment with CAR-T therapies or chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies.

Approved cancer therapies in this class include Bristol Myers Squibb's (BMY.N) Breyanzi and its partnered therapy, Abecma, with 2seventy bio (TSVT.O) .

J&J unit Janssen and Legend Biotech's (LEGN.O) Carvykti, Novartis AG's (NOVN.S) Kymriah, and Gilead's unit Kite's Tecartus and Yescarta are also a part of the investigation.

Shares of Gilead were down marginally, while Legend's stock fell 4.2% in afternoon trading. Autolus Therapeutics (AUTL.O) , which is also developing CAR-T therapies, was down nearly 12%.

RBC analysts said in a note they believed that the concerns could be higher for Novartis' Kymriah, and extremely rare for all the other marketed CAR-Ts.

Gilead said it had cooperated with the FDA on its request for an analysis of the company's data, adding there was no evidence that treatment with either of its two therapies had a causal role in the development of new malignancies.

""We are confident in the overall safety profile of both Tecartus and Yescarta,"" Gilead told Reuters in an emailed statement.

CAR-T therapies, or chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies, generally involve extracting disease-fighting T-cells from a patient, re-engineering them to attack cancer and infusing them back into the body.

J&J, Bristol Myers and Novartis did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.

"BRUKINSA is the first and only BTK inhibitor approved for follicular lymphoma in the European Union

Approval was based on results from the ROSEWOOD trial in which BRUKINSA plus the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody obinutuzumab achieved higher overall response rate compared to obinutuzumab alone

BeiGene, Ltd. BGNE HKEX: 06160, SSE: 688235))), a global biotechnology company, today announced that the European Commission (EC) has granted marketing authorization for BRUKINSA® (zanubrutinib) in combination with obinutuzumab for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) follicular lymphoma (FL) who have received at least two prior lines of systemic therapy. This marks the fourth indication in the European Union (EU) for BRUKINSA, which is now approved to treat more patient populations in the EU than any other Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor.

""With this approval, we are excited to announce that BRUKINSA will become available as a treatment option for patients with follicular lymphoma in the European Union. BRUKINSA is now the first BTK inhibitor approved in this indication and has the broadest label of any medicine in its class globally,"" said Mehrdad Mobasher, M.D., M.P.H., Chief Medical Officer, Hematology at BeiGene. ""This milestone marks a significant advancement in our efforts to combat the disease by providing a new and effective treatment option to patients who have either failed to respond to initial therapies or have experienced a relapse.""

The EC approval is based on positive results from ROSEWOOD (NCT03332017), a global, randomized, open-label Phase 2 study of BRUKINSA plus obinutuzumab compared with obinutuzumab alone in 217 patients with R/R FL who received at least two prior lines of systemic therapy. In the study, the overall response rate was 69.0% in the BRUKINSA plus obinutuzumab arm versus 45.8% in the obinutuzumab arm (P = 0.0012), with a median follow-up of approximately 20 months. Responses were durable with 18-month landmark duration of response (DOR) of 69.3% in the BRUKINSA combination arm.

Additionally, the median progression-free survival (PFS) for patients treated with BRUKINSA plus obinutuzumab was 28.0 months, compared to 10.4 months for patients treated with only obinutuzumab (HR: 0.50 [95% CI: 0.33, 0.75]; P = 0.0007).

BRUKINSA plus obinutuzumab was generally well-tolerated, with safety results consistent with previous studies of both medicines.

""People living with follicular lymphoma often experience relapse and have poor responses to subsequent lines of therapy, making it imperative to improve outcomes,"" said Pier Luigi Zinzani, M.D., Ph.D., Full Professor of Haematology at the Institute of Haematology ""Seràgnoli,"" University of Bologna, Italy. ""The results from the ROSEWOOD trial demonstrated a significant clinical benefit of BRUKINSA plus obinutuzumab for patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma. BRUKINSA is a chemotherapy-free, oral treatment option that can be a practice-changing option for eligible patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma.""

In addition to R/R FL, BRUKINSA is approved in the EU as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, for adult patients with marginal zone lymphoma who have received at least one prior anti-CD20-based therapy, and for adult patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia who have received at least one prior therapy, or in first-line treatment for patients unsuitable for chemo-immunotherapy.

Gerwin Winter, Senior Vice President, Head of Europe at BeiGene noted, ""We have made great progress in making BRUKINSA available to eligible patients with hematological malignancies globally, and this approval is a testament to our continued commitment to bring this much needed treatment option to patients in Europe and around the world. We hope that this approval will have a positive impact on the lives of many people living with follicular lymphoma in the European Union and their families.""

BeiGene currently has submissions for BRUKINSA in R/R FL under review by regulatory authorities including in the United States (U.S.) and China. Additionally, BeiGene's submission for BRUKINSA in R/R FL is under review by regulatory authorities in Canada, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom as part of the Access Consortium New Active Substance Work-sharing Initiative (NASWSI).

BRUKINSA is approved in more than 65 markets, including the U.S., China, EU, Great Britain, Canada, Australia, South Korea, and Switzerland in selected indications and under development for additional indications globally. Product information may differ from country to country. Prescribers should consult the product information approved in their respective countries.

"A federal judge in New York has dismissed a lawsuit that accused McDonald’s and Wendy’s of misleading consumers with ads that show bigger, juicier burgers than their restaurants actually serve. In an opinion released over the weekend, U.S. District Judge Hector Gonzalez said the images on the companies’ websites __ which the plaintiff was challenging __ note the weight of the meat and the calories each burger contains.

Gonzalez also said the plaintiff, Justin Chimienti, failed to prove that a reasonable customer would be misled by the ads. Gonzalez said the ads are considered “puffery,” akin to other companies’ use of models to make their products more visually appealing.

The suit was one of several false advertising lawsuits filed recently against fast food companies by New York attorney James Kelly. A message seeking comment from Kelly was left Tuesday by The Associated Press.

In August, a federal judge in Florida refused to dismiss a class action lawsuit Kelly filed against Burger King claiming that the company’s ads overstate the amount of meat in its Whopper burger and other sandwiches. Kelly has also sued Taco Bell and Arby’s.

Lawsuits accusing food and beverage companies of misleading customers __ for putting fewer chips than expected in a bag or advertising artificial flavors as real “vanilla,” for example __ have grown more common in recent years.

Perkins Coie, a law firm that tracks class action suits, said 214 were filed against food and beverage companies in 2022 and 101 were filed in the first six months of this year.

"The future of fast food delivery is here.

Diners within a 1.2-mile radius of the Brandon/Valrico Chick-fil-A in Central Florida will now have the option to have their spicy chicken sandwiches and milkshakes delivered via drone for a limited time.

Drone delivery is available between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. Monday through Friday, the restaurant announced on social media last week. The fast food joint said it hopes to expand to a 2-mile radius in the near future.

The restaurant partnered with DroneUp, a Virginia-based tech company that also launched a drone delivery service with a Tampa Walmart last year, The Tampa Bay Times reported.

The popular fried chicken chain declined to share where drone delivery would be introduced next.

“We are in the early stages of testing drone delivery at a small number of Chick-fil-A restaurants,” Chick-fil-A spokesperson Chelsea Lee told the local newspaper in an email.

Customers must select the “drone delivery” option on the Chick-fil-A app for special service. Once doing so, employees load their food order into a cardboard box and attach the box to a drone outside of the restaurant, according to a video posted by the restaurant showing how the process works.

The drone then flies the food to its destination, lowers the box with a cable and drops it gently on the ground for the customer to pick up.

Drinks, which are sealed before leaving the restaurant, can also be delivered, the location said.

“Just got ours – that was super fast. Food was hot, perfect – thanks!!!!” one satisfied customer commented on the restaurant’s Facebook page.

Another posted a video of her delivery being dropped off at her home: “The most exciting thing ever,” she quipped.

Drones are the latest delivery innovations Chick-fil-A has been trying. The company announced last May that it was testing out autonomous delivery vehicles at select restaurants across the country.",future fast food delivery diner within radius central florida option spicy chicken sandwich milkshake delivered via drone limited time drone delivery available 10 6 monday friday restaurant announced social medium last week fast food joint said hope expand radius near future restaurant partnered droneup tech company also launched drone delivery service tampa walmart last year tampa bay time reported popular fried chicken chain declined share drone delivery would introduced next early stage testing drone delivery small number restaurant spokesperson chelsea lee told local newspaper email customer must select drone delivery option app special service employee load food order cardboard box attach box drone outside restaurant according video posted restaurant showing process work drone fly food destination lower box cable drop gently ground customer pick drink sealed leaving restaurant also delivered location said got super fast food hot perfect thanks one satisfied customer commented restaurant facebook page another posted video delivery dropped home exciting thing ever quipped drone latest delivery innovation trying company announced last may testing autonomous delivery vehicle select restaurant across country,"The drone then flies the food to its destination, lowers the box with a cable and drops it gently on the ground for the customer to pick up.

"Yum Brands topped Wall Street estimates for third-quarter results on Wednesday as a reboot of popular menu items at Taco Bell and promotional deals at KFC pulled in more budget-strapped customers looking for cheaper restaurant meals.

The company has banked on aggressive promotions and limited-time offers to drive demand, with the return of the fan-favorite Volcano Menu and $5 boxes at Taco Bell helping the chain outpace a broader slowdown in the restaurant industry.

Taco Bell’s deals aided a 2% to 3% increase in customer transactions at the brand in the quarter, Yum Brands CEO David Gibbs said on a post-earnings call.

“There is more pressure on the US consumer … and certainly, our industry has softened a little bit … for us, though, the US is a much more favorable situation because Taco Bell is the majority of our sales and profits (in the country),” Gibbs added.

Taco Bell also plans to improve its loyalty program in a bid to boost order frequency and spending.

Starting next year, the chain would make it easier for members to earn and redeem points and offer perks such as early access to new products.

Meanwhile, Pizza Hut has been losing market share to rivals including Papa John’s, Papa Murphy’s and to a lesser extent Little Caesars, with losses noticeably worsening in September, data from research firm M Science showed.

“We’ve seen a lot of competition in the pizza space … and it is driving the incremental weakness at Pizza Hut,” said Sante Faustini III, director of product intelligence at M Science.

Pizza Hut’s global same-store sales growth of 1% lagged estimates of 2.08% in the quarter, according to LSEG data.

Global same-store sales at Taco Bell and KFC jumped a better-than-expected 8% and 6%, respectively.

The company’s overall same-store sales rose 6%, beating estimates of a 4.73% increase.",yum brand topped wall street estimate result wednesday reboot popular menu item taco bell promotional deal kfc pulled customer looking cheaper restaurant meal company banked aggressive promotion offer drive demand return volcano menu 5 box taco bell helping chain outpace broader slowdown restaurant industry taco bell deal aided 2 3 increase customer transaction brand quarter yum brand ceo david gibbs said call pressure u consumer certainly industry softened little bit u though u much favorable situation taco bell majority sale profit country gibbs added taco bell also plan improve loyalty program bid boost order frequency spending starting next year chain would make easier member earn redeem point offer perk early access new product meanwhile pizza hut losing market share rival including papa john papa murphy lesser extent little caesar loss noticeably worsening september data research firm science showed seen lot competition pizza space driving incremental weakness pizza hut said sante faustini iii director product intelligence science pizza hut global sale growth 1 lagged estimate quarter according lseg data global sale taco bell kfc jumped 8 6 respectively company overall sale rose 6 beating estimate increase,"Taco Bell’s deals aided a 2% to 3% increase in customer transactions at the brand in the quarter, Yum Brands CEO David Gibbs said on a post-earnings call.

"Oct 30 (Reuters) - McDonald's (MCD.N) beat Wall Street estimates for third-quarter profit and sales on Monday, powered by new launches as well as steady demand for its cheaper burgers and fries from diners struggling with still-high food prices.

Shares of the company rose about 2% to $261 in premarket trading as it also raised its quarterly cash dividend by 10%.

The burger giant has been able to keep its meals relatively more affordable following the industry-wide hike in prices last year, helping counter the trend of inflation-hit consumers opting to eat more at home and a decline in footfall.

Global comparable sales at McDonald's jumped 8.8% in the quarter ended Sept. 30, while analysts on average expected a 7.36% rise, according to LSEG data.

Drawing on its history of menu enhancements, McDonald's launched the Cheesy Jalapeno Bacon quarter pounder in July and brought back the fan-favorite Spicy Chicken McNuggets to menus in September.

Both items likely drove solid sales growth in the third quarter, UBS analysts had noted.

While overall dining traffic fell in all three months of the quarter, McDonald's saw a 7.3% jump in July, data from Placer.ai showed.

Footfall strength at the company tapered off in the next two months - recording declines of 1.1% and 3.7% - but remained ahead of the broader industry trends.

Comparable sales in the United States climbed 8.1% in the quarter, beating estimates of a 7.4% increase, thanks also to higher average spending at stores.

Meanwhile, same-store sales in McDonald's international operated markets increased 8.3%, edging past expectations for 8.03% growth.

Total quarterly revenue increased 14% to $6.69 billion, beating estimates of $6.58 billion.

Net income rose to $2.32 billion, or $3.17 per share, from $1.98 billion, or $2.68 per share, a year earlier.

On an adjusted basis, McDonald's posted a per-share profit of $3.19, handily beating estimates of $3.00.",oct 30 reuters mcdonald beat wall street estimate profit sale monday powered new launch well steady demand cheaper burger fry diner struggling food price share company rose 2 261 premarket trading also raised quarterly cash dividend 10 burger giant able keep meal relatively affordable following hike price last year helping counter trend consumer opting eat home decline footfall global comparable sale mcdonald jumped quarter ended 30 analyst average expected rise according lseg data drawing history menu enhancement mcdonald launched cheesy jalapeno bacon quarter pounder july brought back spicy chicken mcnuggets menu september item likely drove solid sale growth third quarter ubs analyst noted overall dining traffic fell three month quarter mcdonald saw jump july data showed footfall strength company tapered next two month recording decline remained ahead broader industry trend comparable sale united state climbed quarter beating estimate increase thanks also higher average spending store meanwhile sale mcdonald international operated market increased edging past expectation growth total quarterly revenue increased 14 billion beating estimate billion net income rose billion per share billion per share year earlier adjusted basis mcdonald posted profit handily beating estimate,"Comparable sales in the United States climbed 8.1% in the quarter, beating estimates of a 7.4% increase, thanks also to higher average spending at stores.

"Whether you dip it, drizzle it, or put it on chicken nuggets or french fries, McDonald’s sauce assortment is expanding this fall.

The fast food chain announced Tuesday that it's adding two new limited-edition sauces to its U.S. menu in two weeks.

The new sauces — McDonald’s Sweet & Spicy Jam and McDonald’s MamboSauce — will hit the menu on Oct. 9, according to a news release from the company.

Are whoppers really too small?Burger King must face whopper of a lawsuit alleging burgers are too small, says judge

What are McDonald's two new sauces?

Here's more about the new limited-edition duo:
• Sweet & Spicy Jam: The chain describes it as a breakfast-inspired ""jammy red pepper dipping sauce with a tongue-numbing Szechuan peppercorn kick."" It also includes apple cider vinegar and cayenne pepper.
• MamboSauce: This one is described by McD's as ""a tomato-based, sweet, spicy and vinegary sauce, inspired by an Washington, D.C. area sauce staple.""

The company came up with the new sauces by exploring ""the incredible tastes and flavors found in communities across the country,"" Tariq Hassan, chief marking and customer experience officer at the chain, said in a news release.

The sauces ""live at the intersection of flavor and culture-pulling from decades of rich food history and tradition in local restaurants and home kitchens, and bringing the delicious spice, sweetness and kick of heat we know today’s customers are craving,"" Hassan said.

McD's said it's teaming up with six foodie content creators to review the sauces so they can share pairing suggestion ideas with customers on their respective TikTok channels.

The creators are: @Mr.Eats305, @sharidyonne, @santanakeish, @misslegarda, @natelovlogs and @blackgirlsexploredc.

"The parent company of Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut is using artificial intelligence to upsell you on tacos, wings and pizza.

Yum! Brands executives told analysts Wednesday they’re using AI to increase sales at select restaurants, with the goal of using the emerging technology in more locations in the coming years.

An artificial intelligence system that suggests other menu items is being tested at a handful restaurants in California, Yum Brands Chief Financial Officer Chris Turner told investors after the company reported third-quarter earnings.

He did not say how many or which restaurants were testing the new technology at and a Yum! Brands representative did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.

Yum! reported a solid three months. The company sold $1.71 billion in fast food during the third quarter, a 4% increase compared to the same period last year. Overall same store sales grew 6%. One of the company’s major restaurant chains, however, saw only tepid growth. Pizza Hut’s same store sales grew only 1% in the quarter that ended Sept. 30 compared to the same period last year.

Turner said AI and other cutting-edge technologies are intended to make workers more efficient, not necessarily replace them.

The system “is in the early stages of piloting and will free up team member time to allow them to focus more on the customer experience,” he said.

Turner did not explain exactly how the AI system works, but he said Taco Bell and other Yum! Brands restaurants use data from customer loyalty programs to customize orders.

This is not the company’s first flirtation with artificial intelligence.

"Having announced a collaboration with Nike in May 2023, Strava has now launched an integration with the Nike Run Club (NRC) and Nike Training Club (NTC) apps.

This new integration enables athletes on Nike’s leading fitness apps to further track their workouts and connect with communities across both the Strava and Nike platforms.

Nike members using the NRC and NTC apps can now begin syncing workouts to Strava by simply authorizing the integration in their apps under settings. In addition to NRC and NTC activity uploads, Strava and Nike members will have access to:
• Nike’s expert content in the Nike-branded club featuring tips, guidance, and motivation from Nike’s coaches and athletes, including Coach Bennett, Chelsea Cox, Jes Woods, and more.
• Challenges on Strava around a shared goal, while enabling athletes to also track their progress and unlock Nike rewards.
• The Strava global community and the more than 750,000 clubs that live within the Strava platform.

“People keep people active – on the Strava platform athletes go 21% farther and workouts last 10% longer when in a group,” said Mateo Ortega, Vice President, Connected Partnerships at Strava.

“Our mission is to help connect our community to the motivation that gets them moving – whether it is a local run club to connect with in-person or inspiration from top athletes and coaches as we’ve seen in the Nike Club on Strava.”

Nike is the latest app provider to join Strava’s platform, which engages over 100 million athletes worldwide.

"Strava has now made it possible for the Nike Run Club (NRC) and Nike Training Club (NTC) apps to work together. The partnership with Nike was first announced in May 2023. With this new feature, athletes using Nike’s top fitness apps can keep better records of their workouts and connect with other people on both the Strava and Nike platforms.

Members of Nike who use the NRC and NTC apps can now start syncing their workouts to Strava. All they have to do is allow the integration in the settings section of their apps. Along with being able to upload NRC and NTC activities, Strava and Nike members will also be able to: Nike’s expert content in the Nike-branded club has advice, tips, and motivation from Coach Bennett, Chelsea Cox, Jes Woods, and other Nike coaches and athletes.

There is no cost to join Nike Run Club. Shoe sales bring in a lot of money for Nike, and they’re killing it at it. It’s like what Steve Jobs said in a company meeting: Nike respects athletes. This app is proof of that. Strava does offer training, but as the app description says, it is still in Beta.

Summit, the $5-a-month pro plan, will let you share and track your location in real time, as well as offer training programmes, more reports with useful information, new trails, and the ability to set and monitor goals. A lot of heart rate monitors and GPS trackers work with Strava. The list is pretty long. Nike Run Club, on the other hand, only works with Nike Training Club, an app that helps you work out at home.

Nike Run Club vs Strava: User Interface and ease of use

Nike Run Club (NRC) has a sleek and visually appealing interface that focuses on being simple and easy to use. The design is clean, which makes the experience nice to look at for users. On top of that, NRC offers a high level of customization by making coaching plans that are specific to each user’s preferences and running habits.

This personal touch makes the whole experience better for the user, making it more interesting and relevant to their fitness goals. Strava, on the other hand, is based on data and is geared towards people who like detailed analytics about their runs or other activities. The platform is famous for its segment-focused approach, which lets users compete with each other on certain routes.

The interface makes these segments stand out, which helps create a competitive and community-driven environment. Strava’s platform is full of useful features that let you keep track of and analyse your workouts. Some users may find all of these features to be too much at first, but there are advanced settings that let you fine-tune and customise the tracking experience.

Because Nike Run Club works with many social media sites, users can share their running accomplishments, recaps, and photos directly on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. With this feature, runners can show off their progress to people outside of the Nike Run Club community. The integration makes it easier for users to interact with their existing social networks, get support, and maybe even get other people to join the platform.

Strava, on the other hand, is known for having a lot of ways to connect with other people. It not only lets users share what they’re doing on different social media sites, but it also encourages them to make friends within the app. Users of Strava can connect with friends, follow other athletes, and join clubs and challenges. This makes the Strava platform a lively and helpful place to be.

Nike Run Club is mostly about the runner’s experience as an individual. It gives runners a way to keep track of their progress, set goals, and get audio-guided workouts. However, Nike Run Club doesn’t offer a lot of ways to talk to each other. It has a simple social feature that lets users share photos, run summaries, and achievements with their friends right in the app. You can interact with each other in some ways, but not as much as with some other fitness apps’ communication tools.

The community and social aspects of Strava, on the other hand, are very important. People who use Strava can stay in touch with friends, join clubs, and take part in challenges. The platform lets users leave more detailed comments on activities, so they can support each other, share their thoughts, and talk about specific runs or routes. Another feature on Strava is called “Segments,” which lets users race to see who can set the fastest time on certain parts of a route. This makes the platform more competitive and fun to use.

Nike Run Club vs Strava: which one should you consider?

Strava and Nike Run Club (NRC) are two of the most popular running apps available today. These apps provide a wide range of features that enable users to keep track of their runs, establish goals, and connect with other runners. On the other hand, there are a number of significant distinctions between the two applications, which may result in one of them working better for you than the other.",strava made possible nike run club nrc nike training club ntc apps work together partnership nike first announced may 2023 new feature athlete using nike top fitness apps keep better record workout connect people strava nike platform member nike use nrc ntc apps start syncing workout strava allow integration setting section apps along able upload nrc ntc activity strava nike member also able nike expert content club advice tip motivation coach bennett chelsea cox jes wood nike coach athlete cost join nike run club shoe sale bring lot money nike killing like steve job said company meeting nike respect athlete app proof strava offer training app description say still beta summit pro plan let share track location real time well offer training programme report useful information new trail ability set monitor goal lot heart rate monitor gps tracker work strava list pretty long nike run club hand work nike training club app help work home nike run club v strava user interface ease use nike run club nrc sleek visually appealing interface focus simple easy use design clean make experience nice look user top nrc offer high level customization making coaching plan specific user preference running habit personal touch make whole experience better user making interesting relevant fitness goal strava hand based data geared towards people like detailed analytics run activity platform famous approach let user compete certain route interface make segment stand help create competitive environment strava platform full useful feature let keep track analyse workout user may find feature much first advanced setting let customise tracking experience nike run club work many social medium site user share running accomplishment recap photo directly facebook instagram twitter feature runner show progress people outside nike run club community integration make easier user interact existing social network get support maybe even get people join platform strava hand known lot way connect people let user share different social medium site also encourages make friend within app user strava connect friend follow athlete join club challenge make strava platform lively helpful place nike run club mostly runner experience individual give runner way keep track progress set goal get workout however nike run club offer lot way talk simple social feature let user share photo run summary achievement friend right app interact way much fitness apps communication tool community social aspect strava hand important people use strava stay touch friend join club take part challenge platform let user leave detailed comment activity support share thought talk specific run route another feature strava called segment let user race see set fastest time certain part route make platform competitive fun use nike run club v strava one consider strava nike run club nrc two popular running apps available today apps provide wide range feature enable user keep track run establish goal connect runner hand number significant distinction two application may result one working better,"Because Nike Run Club works with many social media sites, users can share their running accomplishments, recaps, and photos directly on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.

"Nike (NYSE:NKE) is the leader when it comes to consumer sportswear apparel and footwear. The firm's long history of producing highly innovative, attractive and market-leading products across multiple product categories has made the firm a household name in sporting goods.

While less than stellar earnings through 2022 and early 2023 have soured investor sentiment towards the firm, fundamental profitability and pricing power remains unharmed.

The current potentially 29% undervaluation in shares as derived by The Value Corner's Intrinsic Value Calculation suggests that a great value opportunity may exist in the stock of this market leading firm.

I rate Nike a Strong Buy and believe it could be a great long-term value play.

Nike is an American athletic apparel and footwear company headquartered in Beaverton, Oregon. The firm has grown rapidly over the past 60 years to become the world's largest supplier of athletic shoes and apparel while also having developed an extensive sports equipment business too.

The firm operates their footwear, apparel and sports equipment businesses across a variety of athletic markets and has become a household name within the space.

Their iconic ""just do it"" trademark tagline and swoosh logo have also become a status symbol and are positively viewed in popular culture especially across a younger demographic of buyers.

Although the firm has struggled to match their historic fiscal performance levels over the past three years, Nike is slowly but surely finding its stride again. A move towards a more direct-to-consumer (DTC) oriented distribution approach has proven costly for the firm but should yield benefits in the long term.

John Donahoe is the CEO of the company since late 2019 and has overseen some troubled times at the firm. Nonetheless, I believe Donahoe has the ability and vision required to guide Nike back to record levels of profitability as the firm's DTC pivot begins to bear its fruits.

Despite the incredibly competitive and continuously changing nature of the athletic apparel and footwear markets, I believe Nike has carved out a wide and strong economic moat. The firm has built this moat upon their brand power, technological advantages and diverse set of revenue streams that target multiple different market segments.

Nike not only sells but designs, manufactures and distributes their own apparel, footwear and sports equipment. This allows Nike to rapidly and efficiently create unique, differentiated designs that help the firm stand out from the competition within the market.

Through a history of producing market leading shoes and apparel combined with very effective marketing including the iconic ""Just Do It"" slogan, Nike has managed to develop their brand into an attractive and higher-end choice for consumers.

The more prestigious status associated with the Nike brand allows the firm to enjoy significant pricing power with many of their products priced at higher levels than those of its competitors. Such an ability to command a higher price for their goods creates a positive feedback loop where customers do not evaluate Nike products based on their price, but rather on the perceived quality, technology and image their goods possess.

I believe that the image Nike has constructed around their brand combined with the massive scale upon which they operate increases the attractiveness of their products in the eyes of consumers in a tangible manner. This hypothesis is supported by the higher pricing associated with their products.

Nike also operates the Jordan brand of casual footwear and apparel which has allowed (along with some Nike branded footwear products) the company to target the ultra-high-end segment of the footwear segment. Many of their most iconic Jordan and Nike sneakers retail for upwards of $800 which provides significant margins and further brand reputation for the firm.

The firm also operates the wholly owned Converse brand of sneakers and tennis shoes. I believe this segment while iconic and rich with history provides little economic moat for the firm as their products are essentially interchangeable with competing brands such as Vans made by VF.

I also believe that the extensive brand partnerships Nike has forged with many of the world's most popular athletes and teams increases the brands pricing power to a material extent. Sponsorship deals with the likes of LeBron James, Serena Williams, Tiger Woods and Christiano Ronaldo increase the appeal of their products in the eyes of millions of amateur athletes across the world.

Team-level sponsorship deals also allow the firm to increase their presence within essentially all major sporting areas which further cements their products in the eyes of consumers as a 'professionally approved choice'. These sponsorship deals once again increase the pricing power Nike enjoys within the market.

Nike also derives significant economic moat from their ability and knowledge to innovate effectively within the mostly mature footwear and apparel space. Throughout the decades Nike has created some of the most cutting-edge shoes and sportswear to date with industry changing breakthroughs happening approximately each five years.

This rapid rate of innovation has allowed Nike to outpace its competitors and ensure that it's shoes in particular remain the most technologically advanced offering on the market. Once again, such a tangible competitive advantage both from a business and product perspective allows the firm to differentiate from its competition and charge premium prices for its shoes.

Finally, Nike is no longer just a sportswear company as the firm has rapidly begun expanding their presence within the digital services space. The firm's ""Nike Membership"" allows consumers to purchase a subscription to Nike designed and operated digital services including a host of apps such as Nike Run Club, Training Club and SNKRS.

Nike Membership also offers customers exclusive deals, free shipping and access to special events and launches which further drives the appeal of the brand as a luxury and more exclusive choice.

These digital business segments should help drive the economic moat of the firm moving forwards as it allows customers to become even more devoted and loyal to the brand through integrating Nike apps into their lifestyles. The Run and Training Club apps in particular have become incredibly popular thanks to the innovative features and large userbase present on the app.

Fundamentally, I believe Nike has managed to carveout a wide and robust economic moat in an industry where most competitors enjoy either a narrow or no moat at all. Their unique products combined with massive marketing power have allowed the firm to differentiate from the competition and charge premium prices for their products.

It is this pricing power that allows Nike to earn consistently outsized returns on their invested capital and I believe the firm will continue to dominate the sportswear market for at least the next 15 years to come.

While I usually allocate a 20-25-year competitive advantage stemming from a wide economic moat, I believe a 15-year timeframe is more suitable for Nike. This is due to the highly competitive nature of the sportswear market and the continuously changing tastes and preferences held by consumers within the space.

From an operating performance perspective, Nike is an absolute profitability powerhouse.

The firm's 5Y average gross, operating and net margins of 44.53%, 12.58% and 10.23% are incredibly robust especially given the highly competitive nature of the sportswear market environment. I believe these core profitability metrics illustrate and support the hypothesis that Nike enjoys a tangible pricing power advantage over its competitors.

Nike's 5Y average ROA, ROE and ROIC are 14.22%, 39.21% and 22.26% respectively which highlight just how efficient the firm is with regards to their business operations.

Over the last 10 years Nike's margins have essentially remained unchanged while overall sales and revenue have grown massively. This illustrates that the firm has remained fiscally responsible throughout their rapid growth cycle and continue to enjoy a dominant position within the market as a whole.

When examining Nike's FY23 and recent start to FY24, it is clear that the firm is still firing on all cylinders despite some challenging macroeconomic conditions and the initially turbulent transition towards a more heavily DTC focused distribution network.

FY23 saw Nike grow their total revenues by 10% YoY to over $51.22B with the growth in revenues on a constant currency basis being 16%. This strong growth in revenues was achieved thanks to strong pricing power and volume increases across their North American, European, EMEA, APLA and Greater China regions.

Strong footwear sales lead the charge across the geographic market segments with higher full-price ASP and growth in the Nike Direct business also contributing to these successes.

Nike's North American segment remains their largest with a 44% contribution towards total revenues. However, the greater China region presents Nike with the largest growth opportunity thanks to the rapidly expanding middle class present within the nation demanding more luxury and high-end goods such as the majority of Nike products.

Nike has also strategically begun expanding the marketing presence of their products in China due to the huge investment the CCP has devoted towards the development of a world-class soccer and basketball league. I believe Nike's already massive presence within these segments will allow the firm to exploit the rapid expansion of these two sports in China and therefore expect the Great China market segment to harbor significant growth prospects for Nike.

The firm's pivot towards a DTC model is also beginning to bear fruits for the firm as a whopping 44% of sales were attributed to the distribution segment in FY23.

Nike's Jordan brand also showed significant growth in FY23 boasting 29% organic revenue growth in FY23. Considering that Michael Jordan retired from professional basketball in 2003, the massive and enduring popularity of the brand even today illustrates that Nike are experts at maintaining brand reputation and thus extracting huge revenues from their product lines.

From a sales and revenue perspective, Nike has truly hit a homerun in 2023 and suggests that firm continues to be the dominant brand across essentially ever market segment in which they operate.

However, FY23 saw the firm's gross margins contract by 250 basis points from 46% in FY22 to just 43.5%. This drop was attributed to increasing production, wholesale and input costs along with a lower margin for their Nike Direct business.

While macroeconomic conditions are largely to blame for the slight increase in COGS witnessed by Nike in FY23, the drop in margins for their Nike Direct business was due to increased promotional activity being required to liquidate inventories in FY23.

While this increase in marketing and a potential increase in in-store sales to liquidate inventories suggests some weakness in Nike's ability to sell their products, I largely believe this is still due to the inflationary environment finally beginning to decrease real disposable income for consumers.

Given that Nike products occupy a more premium position within the market, a recessionary period could see sales decline more significantly than a more budget-oriented competitor. Still, I believe Nike's branding power will make their products attractive to consumers and believe the firm will still earn outsized returns on their invested capital despite a slight slowdown in consumer spending.

Net incomes for FY23 fell almost 17% YoY from $6.05B in FY22 to just $5.07B. This weakness was largely due to COGS increasing substantially along with marketing expenses and a slight increase in income tax expenses.

Q1 of FY24 saw Nike's YoY revenue growth slow to just 2% while their COGS increased by an equal 2%. The total cost of selling and administrative expenses also increased by 0.9% as a percentage of revenue in the first quarter as Nike saw pressure from rising pricing levels and marketing requirements to sell their products.

Net income for the first quarter fell just 1% YoY which represents a significant improvement from the full year 2023 results. These positive income statistics were accompanied by a massive 10% reduction in inventories from $9.6B in Q1 FY23 to just $8.7B in Q1 FY24.

These operating improvements suggest that Nike has finally managed to raise the ASP of their products through both wholesale and Nike Direct channels sufficiently to account for the rising pricing levels encountered within their supply network.

Seeking Alpha's Quant calculates an ""A+"" profitability rating for Nike which I believe to be an accurate representation of the profitability powerhouse that is the sportswear giant.

Nike's balance sheets are in outstanding shape thanks to their intelligent capital allocation strategies and significant levels of fiscal restraint.

The firm has $24.3B in total current assets while total current liabilities amount to just $8.46B. This outstanding short-term liquidity leaves the firm with an excellent current ratio of 2.72 and a healthy quick ratio of 1.60.

Total assets for the firm amount to $36.8B with total liabilities just $22.8B. This leaves the firm with an excellent debt/equity ratio of 0.87.

Fundamentally, I believe Nike exhibits one of the healthiest balance sheets of any major corporation currently in business. Their fiscal restraint and smart utilization of debt has allowed the company to grow significantly without excessive interest or fiscal burden.

As of May 31, 2023, Nike has $8.93B in long-term debt. All of the firm's debentures are on fixed interest rates which protects the firm against the rising rate environment currently found in the United States and across the globe as a whole.

Furthermore, Nike's long-term debt profile is well staggered with a majority of debentures maturing post-2026. I believe that even the maturities of around $2B due by 2026 will be easily financed by Nike's massive cashflows (approximately $3.9B unlevered FCF in FY23) thus negating the requirement for Nike to take-on any further debt.

Moody's credit ratings agency affirmed an excellent A1 credit rating for Nike's unsecured domestic notes and affirmed a Prime-1 rating for their domestic commercial paper. The outlook remains stable. Moody's classifies ""A1"" credit ratings as being of the ""highest grade, representing minimum credit risk"" and classifies ""Prime-1"" short-term debt ratings as being of the ""highest quality"".

Considering Nike as a whole it is clear that the firm remains an incredibly profitable enterprise even despite the difficult macro environment and softening consumer demand. Their pricing power is clearly allowing the firm to command excellent margins on their products despite the difficult market environment and should allow the firm to remain significantly profitable even through a recessionary environment.

Nike's excellent capital allocation is evident in their balance sheet and outstandingly staggered debt profile. Moody's affirms their credit risk (or lack thereof in Nike's case).

Seeking Alpha's Quant assigns Nike with an ""F"" Valuation grade. I believe this is an inaccurate representation of the value present within Nike stock and perfectly illustrates how very accurate quant ratings can sometimes poorly represent the real value of a company.

The firm currently trades at a P/E GAAP FWD ratio of 26.05x. Nike's P/CF FWD of just 22.54x is reasonable and actually represents a historically lower ratio. Their FWD EV/EBITDA of just 20.19x is acceptable in my opinion especially when considering the firm's EV/Sales FWD of just 2.84.

Considering only these basic valuation metrics alone I believe Nike should already start to appear slightly undervalued given the strong and continued growth prospects present at the firm. While these metrics are elevated versus a sector median (which is how the quant derives its letter grade for Nike), I believe that Nike is a truly outstanding firm within the market.

From an absolute perspective, Nike shares are trading at a significant discount relative to previous valuations. Seeking Alpha's charts illustrate that Nike has produced just 27% returns over the past five years due to the massive sell-off in shares starting in late 2021 dropping valuations by almost 40%.

Significant negative market sentiment following Nike's convoluted and mixed set of fiscal results from late 2021 until 2023 soured investor sentiments and has led to what I believe to be an excessive selloff in shares.

While the relative valuation provided by simple metrics and ratios along with the absolute comparison begin to paint the value picture present in Nike shares, a quantitative approach to valuing the stock is essential.

By utilizing The Value Corner's specially formulated Intrinsic Valuation Calculation, we can better understand what value exists in the company from a more objective perspective.

Using Nike's current share price of $96.88, an estimated 2025 EPS of $4.32, a realistic ""r"" value of 0.14 (14%) and the current Moody's Seasoned AAA Corporate Bond Yield ratio of 5.13x, I derive a base-case IV of $136.00. This represents a substantial 29% undervaluation in the firm.

When using a more pessimistic CAGR value for r of 0.11 (11%) to reflect a scenario where Nike struggles to increase net incomes due to a recessionary environment impacting sales negatively, shares are still valued at around 113.00 representing a 15% undervaluation.

Considering the valuation metrics, absolute valuation and intrinsic value calculation, I believe Nike is firmly trading in value territory.

In the short term (3-12 months), I find it difficult to say exactly what may happen to valuations. While market sentiment has improved over the last quarter for the firm, weaker than anticipated Q2 results could lead to another selloff in shares.

Tax harvesting may also lead to an increased selloff in shares as many investors seek to maximize the tax efficiency of their portfolios as the year winds to a close.

In the long-term (2-10 years), I see Nike strengthening their position as the dominant player in the footwear and sportswear industry.

While a gain in market share would only really be possible either through acquisitions of competitors or through the development of a huge technological breakthrough, I believe Nike is well positioned to benefit from overall market growth in China, EMEA and North America.

Nike faces significant risks stemming primarily from the competitive and cyclical consumer discretionary market in which they operate along with substantial exposure to unfavorable FX rates and some material ESG concerns.

While Nike has carved-out a tangible economic moat in the consumer sportswear and footwear marketplace, the firm remains susceptible to the threat of falling profitability through increased competition and cyclical market lows.

The entrance of a new and trendy brand or company could harm Nike's image and lead to brand stagnation requiring increased marketing costs from the sportswear giant to remain competitive. This could harm really gross and operating margins significantly.

The potential for the U.S. and global economies as a whole to enter a recessionary period in late 2023 and early 2024 also places Nike at risk of falling consumer demand necessitating increased marketing and a drop in ASP to clear inventories. This would once again decrease the firm's margins and ROIC in a tangible manner.

Nike's over 56% exposure to international markets as a percentage of total revenues also places the firm in a position to be negatively impacted by the strengthening dollar. While revenue and sales growth continued to be strong in FY23, weaker international currencies in comparison to the U.S. dollar has harmed the firm's overall profitability slightly.

From an ESG perspective, Nike remains engaged in significant labor treatment disputes and continues to be marred by accusations of poor working conditions being present within their manufacturing network.

The firm has also recently faced accusations of harboring a culture of sexism and bullying along with a retaliatory approach taken by management towards mistakes and voicing opinions.

While these controversies have not impacted revenues or sales nor the reputation of their products on a whole, the potential for this to occur to me seems plausible given a long enough timeframe.

Therefore, while the firm has claimed multiple commitments to ensuring equitable working conditions for its staff across the globe along with a desire to reduce GHG emission in the long-term, Nike must execute these ESG promises to ensure damage is not done to their invaluable brand image.

I find it difficult to decide whether or not Nike would be suitable for an ESG conscious investor. However, despite the firm's real social troubles, I believe the lack of substantial environmental or governance concerns could make it an acceptable if not stellar pick for the more ESG conscious investor.

Of course, opinions may vary and I implore you to conduct your own ESG and sustainability research before investing in Nike if these matters are of concern to you.

Nike is the dominant player in the sportswear and footwear markets. Their massive catalogue of products spans essentially every major sports category and tactical sponsorship deals along with great marketing material has made their products aspirational in nature for many consumers.

This has earned the firm a wide economic moat which should help the company earn outsized ROIC for the foreseeable future. While the company does face some real risks to profitability, I believe that in the long-term the firm will remain at the helm of the consumer sportswear segment.

Furthermore, the current potentially 29% discount in shares means that Nike stock can finally be acquired at what is a great valuation.

Therefore, I rate Nike a Strong Buy from a deep-value perspective and believe the stock could be a real 'multi-bagger' given the current discount and potential for significant long-term future growth in new market environments.

Nonetheless, I believe Donahoe has the ability and vision required to guide Nike back to record levels of profitability as the firm's DTC pivot begins to bear its fruits.

"Oct 23 (Reuters) - Unilever (ULVR.L) and a charity supporting teenage cancer patients resolved their trademark dispute over Unilever's use of the phrase ""Not Done Yet"" to market its Degree deodorant and other products, according to a filing on Monday in New York federal court.

Unilever and the I'm Not Done Yet Foundation have settled the charity's lawsuit in principle, according to an entry on the court's docket. Representatives for Unilever and the foundation did not immediately respond to requests for comment and more information.

The Garden City, New York-based I'm Not Done Yet Foundation was created by Peter Menges, whose son Bobby died of cancer at 19, to support adolescent and young-adult cancer patients and survivors. The foundation's lawsuit from July said that it has been using its name since 2018 and owns federal ""I'm Not Done Yet"" and ""Not Done Yet"" trademarks.

According to the lawsuit, Unilever's motivational ""Not Done Yet"" ad campaign threatened to cause consumer confusion and hurt the charity's fundraising efforts. The foundation also said that Unilever's use of the phrase in connection with its social impact programs increases the risk of confusion.

The case is I'm Not Done Yet Foundation v. Conopco Inc d/b/a Unilever, U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, No. 1:23-cv-05581.

For the foundation: Dyan Finguerra-DuCharme and Mallory Chandler of Pryor Cashman

"LONDON, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Nestle said on Tuesday it has picked WPP Openmind to be its sole media agency in Europe, as the world's biggest packaged food maker seeks to target consumers more efficiently amid a cost of living crisis that is changing shopping habits.

Scoring Nestle's agency business is a major win for WPP Openmind at a time when global ad spending is falling. WPP (WPP.L) , the world's top advertising group, in August downgraded its full-year growth forecast due to lower spending by technology companies.

""The result (of the contract) will be better decision-making and media planning to allow campaigns to build brands and win consumer attention at scale,"" a Nestle spokesperson said in a statement.

WPP Openmind will coordinate Nestle's marketing communications -- from space buying and planning to campaign activation -- for its more than 2,000 brands including Kit Kat and Nescafe.

1. Dietitians are being paid to post videos on TikTok and Instagram promoting sugar, aspartame and dietary supplements, according to an analysis by the Examination and The Washington Post. The Canadian Sugar Institute and American Beverage, which represents PepsiCo and Coca-Cola, are among the trade and lobbying groups paying influencer registered dietitians to push products in posts that often include unproven claims and questionable messages about nutrition and healthy eating. While it’s not uncommon for social media influencers with large followings to partner with companies and brands to create paid content, the investigation found that many dietitians did not make clear their connections with the food and beverage industry.

2. A coordinated disinformation campaign by China spread bogus AI-generated content and disinformation online about the devastating wildfires in Hawaii last month, adopting themes and tactics from similar Russian operations. This approach, researchers say, represents a notable shift for Chinese disinformation campaigns, which have previously focused on supporting China’s own policies rather than stoking divisions in the United States. Researchers from several organizations, including Microsoft, NewsGuard and the RAND Corporation, identified the network of social media accounts China built and suggested it may be used for future influence operations — like the 2024 U.S. presidential election.

NewsLit takeaway: False claims are often built on previously laid tropes and narratives. A video of smoke billowing from a helicopter may not seem suspicious to most internet users, but those who have been exposed to repeated false claims about population control and Gates may be tempted to believe these clips show mosquitoes being secretly released. News literacy skills, such as reverse image searches, lateral reading and critical thinking, can prevent people from falling into these conspiratorial rabbit holes.

NewsLit takeaway: Removing interesting and genuine footage from its original context and sharing it as if it pertained to a trending discussion is a surefire way for purveyors of misinformation to get clicks and views. Fortunately, these mislabeled visuals are typically easy to put back into their original context with a quick reverse image search. In this case, the Associated Press traced the footage back to an art gallery and received a comment from the gallery owner, saying: “This is definitely not true! It is an artwork!” This false claim may have seemed genuine to some viewers because airlines have been reducing the size of economy airline seats. The idea of odd seating is not new — such as with double-decker seats — but there’s no evidence airlines are going to start using these seats anytime soon. Still, some people may find themselves asking, “If the airlines would do this, what else might they do?” This thinking is known as a slippery slope, a fallacious argument that says the occurrence of one event will lead to more extreme events, and it is frequently exploited by misinformation.",get smart news modeled sift free weekly newsletter public nlp free platform checkology help educator teach middle high school student identify credible information seek reliable source know trust dismiss debunk also give student appreciation importance first amendment free press 1 dietitian paid post video tiktok instagram promoting sugar aspartame dietary supplement according analysis examination washington post canadian sugar institute american beverage represents pepsico among trade lobbying group paying influencer registered dietitian push product post often include unproven claim questionable message nutrition healthy eating uncommon social medium influencers large following partner company brand create paid content investigation found many dietitian make clear connection food beverage industry 2 coordinated disinformation campaign china spread bogus content disinformation online devastating wildfire hawaii last month adopting theme tactic similar russian operation approach researcher say represents notable shift chinese disinformation campaign previously focused supporting china policy rather stoking division united state researcher several organization including microsoft newsguard rand corporation identified network social medium account china built suggested may used future influence operation like 2024 presidential election newslit takeaway false claim often built previously laid trope narrative video smoke billowing helicopter may seem suspicious internet user exposed repeated false claim population control gate may tempted believe clip show mosquito secretly released news literacy skill reverse image search lateral reading critical thinking prevent people falling conspiratorial rabbit hole newslit takeaway removing interesting genuine footage original context sharing pertained trending discussion surefire way purveyor misinformation get click view fortunately mislabeled visuals typically easy put back original context quick reverse image search case associated press traced footage back art gallery received comment gallery owner saying definitely true artwork false claim may seemed genuine viewer airline reducing size economy airline seat idea odd seating new seat evidence airline going start using seat anytime soon still people may find asking airline would else might thinking known slippery slope fallacious argument say occurrence one event lead extreme event frequently exploited misinformation,"Dietitians are being paid to post videos on TikTok and Instagram promoting sugar, aspartame and dietary supplements, according to an analysis by the Examination and The Washington Post.

If you’re considering opening a bank account with Wells Fargo, take note of the current promotions: You can earn a quick buck without too much effort.

Still, a promotion shouldn’t be the only reason you open an account at a particular bank.

Account details and annual percentage yields (APYs) are accurate as of November 3, 2023.

Wells Fargo currently has a few promotions on some of its savings and checking accounts. Continue reading for promotion details and to find out how to qualify.

New Wells Fargo customers can earn a $300 bonus by opening a Wells Fargo Everyday Checking account in person or online with a $25 initial deposit.

The Everyday Checking is the bank’s most popular checking account. With a contactless debit card and features like Bill Pay, overdraft protection and Zelle, it’s got everything you need in a basic checking account — but nothing above and beyond.

To get the bonus, you must receive a total of $1,000 worth of qualifying electronic deposits within 90 days of opening your account.

You have to provide a bonus offer code when applying for your account in order to receive the bonus, which you can get by submitting your email address on the account promotion webpage.

The Everyday Checking account has a $10 monthly service fee. But you can avoid the fee by meeting one of the following requirements during each statement period:
• Receive $500 or more in total qualifying electronic deposits.
• Be between the ages of 17 and 24 — once you turn 25, age can no longer be used to avoid the fee.
• Link your account to a Wells Fargo Campus ATM Card or Campus Debit Card.

The Premier Checking account offers new customers a $2,500 bonus when they begin a banking relationship with Wells Fargo Premier. You can only open this account in person.

If you have a large enough balance to warrant it, you may want to consider the Premier Checking account. This interest-bearing account features special service discounts and tailored banking services. Additional features and perks include:

While there’s no minimum balance requirement, there’s a $25 opening deposit and a $35 waivable monthly service fee. But unless you have a significant account balance, other Wells Fargo Checking accounts may be a better fit.

You can earn the $2,500 bonus by opening a Premier Checking account with an opening deposit of $25 and by meeting the following criteria:
• Bring at least $250,000 of new deposits to qualifying linked accounts within 45 days of account opening.
• Maintain a minimum balance of $250,000 through the first 90 days after account upgrade or opening.

You’ll also need to provide a bonus offer code — which you can get by providing your email address on the account promotion webpage — when you apply. You’ll need to bring this code with you to the bank, as this account is only available in person.

The Wells Fargo Premier Checking account has a $35 monthly service fee. But you can have the fee waived by having $250,000 or more in statement-ending qualified balances in linked accounts.

Customers new to saving with Wells Fargo can get a $525 bonus for opening a Way2Save® Savings account with a minimum deposit of $25. This account can only be opened in person.

The Wells Fargo Way2Save Savings account is a low-cost savings account you can open with just $25. But interest on this savings account is only 0.15% APY — nowhere near what you could earn by opening a savings account or certificate of deposit (CD) at many online banks.

With the Way2Save account, you can take advantage of Wells Fargo’s widespread presence. The account comes with an ATM card and access to more than 12,000 Wells Fargo ATMs. Other perks include mobile banking and optional overdraft protection.

You can earn a $525 bonus by opening a new Way2Save account with a $25 opening deposit and by doing the following:
• Deposit $25,000 or more into your new account within 30 days of opening.
• Maintain a balance of $25,000 through the first 90 days after account opening.

You’ll also need to provide a bonus offer code to the banker when opening your new account. You can get a code by providing your email address on the account promotion webpage.

The Way2Save savings account has a $5 monthly service fee, but you can avoid it by meeting one of these requirements each fee period:
• Make one automatic transfer of at least $25 each fee period from a linked Wells Fargo checking account.
• Make one automatic transfer of at least $1 each business day from a linked Wells Fargo checking account.
• Make one or more Save As You Go® transfers from a linked Wells Fargo checking account.
• Be under 25 years old.

Wells Fargo’s current promotions for its checking and savings accounts are noteworthy. Not all banks offer promotions, so the fact that you can earn a bonus with minimal effort is an advantage, no matter the cash value.

Wells Fargo’s current offers are comparable to those at other banks. For example, JPMorgan Chase Bank is offering a $200 bonus for opening a Chase Total Checking® account (offer expires Jan. 24, 2024) and Axos Bank® is offering a $300 bonus for opening a Rewards Checking account (offer expires Jan. 1, 2024). Citi Bank is currently advertising a bonus of up to $2,000 with a Citi® checking account, but you need a balance of $300,000 to earn it (offer expires Jan. 9, 2024). As far as competitors go, Wells Fargo’s bonuses, for the most part, match or exceed them.

But promotions aren’t the only thing to consider when opening a new bank account. Even though Wells Fargo offers impressive bonuses, its accounts have monthly fees and don’t earn much — if anything — in terms of interest. If you don’t qualify for waived monthly fees, you might be better off with a free checking account or high-yield savings account.

Founded in 1852, Wells Fargo is one of the largest banks in the U.S. and has thousands of physical branches and ATMs throughout the country. Rates on savings accounts are low compared to high-yield savings accounts, but if you like to bank in person Wells Fargo is worth considering.

They offer a full range of banking products, including checking, savings, CDs, credit cards, loans, mortgages and investment services.",editorial note blueprint may earn commission affiliate partner link featured site commission influence editor opinion evaluation please view full advertiser disclosure policy verified expert mean article thoroughly reviewed evaluated accuracy verified expert mean article thoroughly reviewed evaluated accuracy considering opening bank account well fargo take note current promotion earn quick buck without much effort still promotion reason open account particular bank account detail annual percentage yield apys accurate november 3 2023 well fargo currently promotion saving checking account continue reading promotion detail find qualify new well fargo customer earn 300 bonus opening well fargo everyday checking account person online 25 initial deposit everyday checking bank popular checking account contactless debit card feature like bill pay overdraft protection zelle got everything need basic checking account nothing beyond get bonus must receive total worth qualifying electronic deposit within 90 day opening account provide bonus offer code applying account order receive bonus get submitting email address account promotion webpage everyday checking account 10 monthly service fee avoid fee meeting one following requirement statement period receive 500 total qualifying electronic deposit age 17 24 turn 25 age longer used avoid fee link account well fargo campus atm card campus debit card premier checking account offer new customer bonus begin banking relationship well fargo premier open account person large enough balance warrant may want consider premier checking account account feature special service discount tailored banking service additional feature perk include minimum balance requirement 25 opening deposit 35 waivable monthly service fee unless significant account balance well fargo checking account may better fit earn bonus opening premier checking account opening deposit 25 meeting following criterion bring least new deposit qualifying linked account within 45 day account opening maintain minimum balance first 90 day account upgrade opening also need provide bonus offer code get providing email address account promotion webpage apply need bring code bank account available person well fargo premier checking account 35 monthly service fee fee waived qualified balance linked account customer new saving well fargo get 525 bonus opening saving account minimum deposit 25 account opened person well fargo way2save saving account saving account open 25 interest saving account apy nowhere near could earn opening saving account certificate deposit cd many online bank way2save account take advantage well fargo widespread presence account come atm card access well fargo atm perk include mobile banking optional overdraft protection earn 525 bonus opening new way2save account 25 opening deposit following deposit new account within 30 day opening maintain balance first 90 day account opening also need provide bonus offer code banker opening new account get code providing email address account promotion webpage way2save saving account 5 monthly service fee avoid meeting one requirement fee period make one automatic transfer least 25 fee period linked well fargo checking account make one automatic transfer least 1 business day linked well fargo checking account make one save transfer linked well fargo checking account 25 year old well fargo current promotion checking saving account noteworthy bank offer promotion fact earn bonus minimal effort advantage matter cash value well fargo current offer comparable bank example jpmorgan chase bank offering 200 bonus opening chase total account offer expires 24 2024 axos offering 300 bonus opening reward checking account offer expires 1 2024 citi bank currently advertising bonus checking account need balance earn offer expires 9 2024 far competitor go well fargo bonus part match exceed promotion thing consider opening new bank account even though well fargo offer impressive bonus account monthly fee earn much anything term interest qualify waived monthly fee might better free checking account saving account founded 1852 well fargo one largest bank thousand physical branch atm throughout country rate saving account low compared saving account like bank person well fargo worth considering offer full range banking product including checking saving cd credit card loan mortgage investment service,"New Wells Fargo customers can earn a $300 bonus by opening a Wells Fargo Everyday Checking account in person or online with a $25 initial deposit.
